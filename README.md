2. After installing BepInEx, run the game once so BepInEx can generate its default directory and file structure.
3. Copy the NOCursorOverride FOLDER to the game's BepInEx plugins folder.
4. To create your own custom cursor, make an PNG image with transparent background, and replace CursorImages/DefaultImage.png with it. Make sure the name MATCHES. Better support will be added later for customization if there is demand, or send a PR otherwise if you want. ^^
